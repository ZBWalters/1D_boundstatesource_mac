This is a variant of the 1D least action propagator code which propagates the
deviation from a field-free source wavefunction.  Thus, in addition to the
action accumulated due to the Hamiltonian, there will be a time dependent
inhomogeneous source term due to the action of the field on the field free
wavefunction.  

The motivation for setting things up in this way is that we would like to find
the tunnel ionization from a 1D slice of a field free wavefunction.  Since the
1D slice does not have enough information to treat the bound state
wavefunction correctly, we will simply take it as a given:
H0 psi0 = E0 psi0
and solve for the deviation
i d/dt (psi0 + dpsi)=(H0+delta H)(psi0+dpsi)

Substituting the Ansatz that psi0(t)=psi0(0)Exp(- i E0 t), this yields

i d/dt(dpsi)=(H0+delta H)dpsi + (delta H) psi0(0)exp(-i E0 t)

so that the bound wavefunction appears as an inhomogeneous source term.

Conceptually, this is very similar to PPT theory, except that we're no longer
using the stationary phase approximation to approximate U(t,t') and (for the
moment) we're just looking at a 1D slice.  In the end, this will yield

dpsi(t)=\int_{t0}^{t} dt' U(t,t') psi0(t)
